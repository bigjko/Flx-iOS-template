Just a stripped down source of the Canabalt flixel iOS source.  All Canabalt specific stuff has been removed (as far as I know, let me know if there's still some left..)
Currently just starts in landscape mode, and displays HelloWorld.

To use it as a template drop the whole folder into Developers/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Project Templates/Application folder

Hope this can help some people get started with Flixel on iPhone.

Currently only tested with the iPhone Simulator!
